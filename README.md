# Media Processor Example

Angular example of the package `@pexip/media-processor`. In this example you will see how to apply different effects to a
live video.

We use `getUserMedia` to get the camera feed and we display it into a `<video>` element.

## How to use

In this demo we will have a selector to choose the effect that we want to apply. By default `No Effect` is selected, so
you will see the original camera feed:

<div align='center'>

![none](./images/none.png)

</div>

If you change the selector to `Blur` the selfie segmentation will be applied and you will see that the background is
blurred.

<div align='center'>

![blur](./images/blur.png)

</div>

Finally, if you select `Background Replacement Effect`, you will see that the background is changed for the image
located in `public/backgrounds/background.png`.

<div align='center'>

![background](./images/background.png)

</div>
